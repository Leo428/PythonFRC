This is going to be a projects for team 1138's FRC robots development. 
It will be leading by Leo Hu, real name old driver. 
There are lots of objects I am going to achieve in this project. 
  - First, I would like to experiment the possibility for the team to switch to Python coding on the robot instead of C++  
  - Second, new feature will be tested and added into this project, such as ^Vision Processing^!

### The Zen of Python by Tim Peters
```python 
import this
```
<
  Beautiful is better than ugly.
  Explicit is better than implicit.
  Simple is better than complex.
  Complex is better than complicated.
  Flat is better than nested.
  Sparse is better than dense.
  Readability counts.
  Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
  Although practicality beats purity.
  Errors should never pass silently.
  Unless explicitly silenced.
  In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
  There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
  Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
  Now is better than never.
  Although never is often better than *right* now.
  If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
  If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
  Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!

- _This is quoting from the famous python author, hope you guys learn from it and hope my project is blessed and protected 
by the spirit of python!_
