This is going to be a projects for team 1138's FRC robots development. 
It will be leading by Leo Hu, real name old driver. 
There are lots of objects I am going to achieve in this project. 
  - First, I would like to experiment the possibility for the team to switch to Python coding on the robot instead of C++  
  - Second, new feature will be tested and added into this project, such as ^Vision Processing^!

### The Zen of Python
> import this 
- Beautiful is better than ugly.
- Explicit is better than implicit.
- Simple is better than complex.
- Complex is better than complicated.
- Flat is better than nested.
- Sparse is better than dense.
- Readability counts.
- Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
- Although practicality beats purity.
- Errors should never pass silently.
- Unless explicitly silenced.
- In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
- There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
- Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
- Now is better than never.
- Although never is often better than *right* now.
- If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
- If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
- Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!

This is quoting from the famous python author, hope you guys learn from it and hope my project is blessed and protected 
by the spirit of python!
